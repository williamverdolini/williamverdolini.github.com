Thanks for the question.

Answering is easy: **Angular Schematics** is a scaffolding tool. So we solve all that kind of problems that scaffolding solve:

- **"blank sheet" syndrome**: blah blah blah
- **Where did we use it?**
- **copy & paste all, errors too**
- **Each one goes where her heart goes**

My journey is: modal, ngrx api flow
