<p>I’ve already explained <a href="/2014/12/01/umbup-intro" target="_blank">why we choose Umbraco</a> as our core framework.
Recently we have <a href="/Umbraco-Upgrade.html" target="_blank">migrated from 4.7.1 to 6.2.4</a> and we started also a migration from WebForms framework to MVC. Our main goals were Design (aka Quality) and Performance.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p>In the next articles I’ll show some basic components of a modular architecture built upon Umbraco framework. What I’ll share is not code for production
environment, because some very important aspect - especially for a configurable product - is missing, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>form validation</li>
  <li>macro’s unique IDs management</li>
  <li>command’s configurability</li>
  <li>command’s consuming rules management (“who listens who”)</li>
  <li>internationalization</li>
  <li>and much others</li>
</ul>

<p>But, anyway, I think that the approach described in the following articles will be clear and easily applicable.
As always, any suggestions are welcome.</p>

<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>
<p>Before to start, some steps in order to make working the <a href="https://github.com/williamverdolini/Umbraco-CustomMacros" target="_blank">shared code</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download or fork <a href="https://github.com/williamverdolini/Umbraco-CustomMacros" target="_blank">the repository</a>.</li>
  <li>Build and run. The web.config is setup in order to launch Umbraco Installer for a fresh new Umbraco application</li>
  <li>follow the standard Installation Wizard. The project is tested on MS SQL Server 2008 R2 (but I don’t see problems if you use some later version).</li>
  <li>At the last step of wizard choose to NOT install a starter kit</li>
  <li>You’re done</li>
</ol>

<p>Go to the root page and have fun!</p>

<p><em>I know…another “To-Do List application”…</em>, but that’s not the point! :)</p>

<p>If you open the Umbraco back-office panel you’ll see my sample pages already configured. In the next articles I’ll go deeper into these configurations.</p>
