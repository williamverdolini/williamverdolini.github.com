<h2 id="the-umbracos-idea">The Umbraco’s Idea</h2>
<p>Umbraco is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">CMS</a> Product. Its mission is to allow users to easily write and publish their own web contents. I don’t want to explain all the Umbraco functionalities 
(see <a href="https://our.umbraco.org/documentation" target="_blank">official docs</a>), but just highlight the basic idea around which Umbraco is based. Each page in Umbraco has two main properties, that are the Umbraco’s pillars:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Document Type</strong>: defines the types of the pages that the back-office users can create in the content tree. Each document type contains different properties or fields. 
Each field has a specific data type (e.g. text, number). In a MVC context, Document types are the Models passed to the Views</li>
  <li><strong>Template</strong>: is where you define the HTML markup of your pages. In a MVC context, templates are the Views</li>
</ol>

<p>Each Content Page should be of a specific Document Type and can be associate to more templates (to render same data in different layout) and Umbraco, in the MVC 
context, use this back-office configurations in his <a href="https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/6.2.5/src/Umbraco.Web/Mvc/RenderMvcController.cs" target="_blank">specific Controller</a> 
to manage the connections between actions, Models (Document types) and Views (Templates).</p>

<h3 id="macros-in-rich-text-editor">Macros in Rich Text Editor</h3>
<p>As .NET developer, one of the most interesting Umbraco feature is the ability to let the web-site administrator to add not only static content, 
but also dynamic components, or, as Umbraco has named, <em>Macros</em>.</p>

<p>This is possible thanks to the capability to add Macros into Rich-Text Editor elements in the Content Page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/umbracomacros/Umbraco-macro-rte.png" class="img-rounded" style="width: 100%; height:100%" /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Ok, but why this is so interesting for a .NET developer? 
Because a macro is a .NET (<em>familiar</em>) component. In fact, a Macro could be a WebForm User Control,
or MVC Partial view! 
The same we daily work with!</p>

<p><img src="/images/umbracomacros/Umbraco-macros.png" class="img-rounded" style="width: 100%; height:100%" /><br /><br /></p>

<p>Besides that, Umbraco allows to define macro’s properties that can be set by the web-site administrator, 
adding some configuration lever to the macros depending on property’s values.</p>

<h2 id="the-custom-macros-idea">The Custom Macro’s Idea</h2>
<p>So, Macros are good candidates to play the role of business modules that could be composed in pages in different ways, depending on customer’s needs.</p>

<p>The real challenge, now, is to create macros that are <em><strong>agnostic</strong></em> about what there’s around them. What does it mean?
It means that a macro should communicate with other macros without knowing what other macros are in the same page. 
Think about a product grid and a product detail; these should be two macros that can communicate to each other (when user click on a product in the grid, 
the product detail should update its data), but without knowing how the other macro is made, because it is depending on costumer’s configuration.</p>

<p>Indeed, customer A could want to display product detail in the same page, while customer B in a modal dialog, while customer C in a different page..and so on, but we 
want to have just one macro for product grid, and just one macro for product detail.</p>

<p>To do that I’ve created a basic architecture in which every single macro can emit and handle commands. Commands are the language used by macros to communicate to each other.</p>

<p><img src="/images/umbracomacros/Umbraco-macros-architecture.png" class="img-rounded" style="width: 100%; height:100%" /><br /><br /></p>

<p>In the above picture you can see the communication flow among components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Umbraco composes the page using the back-office configurations. Macros in RTE are inserted as MVC child partial views (in the MVC framework).</li>
  <li>each user action is a <strong>Command</strong> that the architecture can translate in MVC language (actions) in order to send them to the server components. 
There are two main parts of this basic architecture:</li>
  <li>a client one (<a href="https://github.com/williamverdolini/Umbraco-CustomMacros/blob/master/CustomMacros/Areas/Framework/Scripts/Command.Engine.js" target="_blank"><strong>Command.Engine.js</strong></a>) responsible to translate client commands into actions</li>
  <li>a server-side one (Controllers derived from <a href="https://github.com/williamverdolini/Umbraco-CustomMacros/blob/master/CustomMacros/Areas/Infrastructure/Controllers/MacroController.cs" target="_blank"><strong>MacroController</strong></a>) responsible to implement business logic into the command handlers</li>
  <li>as final step, Command.Engine replaces the macro area with the HTML result from server</li>
</ol>

<p>In the next articles I’ll explain some other details about the flow, but before that, it’s important to see something about Dependency Injection.</p>
