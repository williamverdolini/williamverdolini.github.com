<p>So…after several attempts and insights I have decided to abandon the prototype of Umbraco upgrade to version 7, although I had achieved the following results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The run-time application worked flawlessly</li>
  <li>The back-office was able to view the templates, document types and their hierarchies and macros</li>
  <li>The back-office was able to view the content of the CMS pages</li>
</ul>

<p>The decision to abandon the prototype was dictated by the following evidence/awareness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Umbraco 7, compared to 6, had completely changed the back-office, introducing several changes to the database and technology (Angular.js)</li>
  <li>Our application has several customized back-office features, which would be rewritten or strongly re-engineered</li>
  <li>Umbraco version 6 is a “live” version, parallel to Umbraco 7</li>
  <li>I’ve spent almost two of the three weeks, whose my time-box is made of</li>
</ul>

<p>And the most important awareness: <strong>prototypes can fail</strong>. <br />
It’s their nature.</p>

<p>But it’s much easier to learn from failures than from successes, especially if you have followed a lean and effective prototyping technique.</p>

<p>Let me just say that I’ve started the <a href="/2014/12/02/umbup-process/" target="_blank">Upgrade process</a> again with Umbraco version 6.2.4 and I’ve reached the same results achieved with Umbraco 7 in less than <strong>6 hours</strong>, while the cost of the previous prototype was <strong>5.5 wordays</strong>!<br />
How?</p>

<p>Thanks to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>acquired skills</li>
  <li>well documented steps</li>
  <li>code versioning</li>
  <li>clear goals and conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>It was time to get things done!</p>
