We have a web app application that has developed upon <a href="http://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cms" target="_blank">Umbraco CMS</a>. Umbraco is very a flexible and good CMS we have chosen some years ago because:

-	It’s in .NET framework: our land.
-	It’s flexible and extensible: it allows us to add custom functionalities using pluggable (familiar) .NET user control
-	We wanted to focus on business functionalities, without spending too much time/money developing some trasversal aspects (user/account management, content management, back-office features, etc). Umbraco has them out of the box.
-	It’s open-source. That allows us to customize even core functionalities if we need it.
-	It has a good and live community.
-	It has a lot of downloadable plugins for CMS (that is not our core business)

The first stable release of our web application was delivered on january 2013. It was on Umbraco version 4.7.1.
During this period, we focused just on business functionalities, in order to give to our customers the most competitive features, but in the meanwhile Umbraco has grown and has added some important features, first of all the abilities to use AspNet.MVC framework.
Now it’s time to upgrade to the latest Umbraco release.
The following articles describe the prototyping steps that allowed me to upgrade and jump from version 4.7.1 to 6.2.4.
Not without some obstacle and failure.
And in these articles I wanted to highlight some principles concretely used during this prototype. 

_Because prototyping is an hard discipline_.
