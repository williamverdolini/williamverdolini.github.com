I order to have a "to-be" database to compare with, I've made a basic Umbraco installation from scratch.
here are the steps done:

<ol>
<li>I've downloaded the <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/download" target="_blank">Umbraco latest release</a> (.zip)</li>
<li>I've unzipped Umbraco release in a local folder. For simplicity I've created an "umbraco_original" folder, that I've used also as backup of original code</li>
<li>I've created a new database on SQL Server 2008 R2</li>
<li>I've created a new Empty Web Project (.NET 4.5) in Visual Studio <br/><br/>			
			<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/umbracoupd/vsproject.png" class="img-rounded" style="width: 100%; height:100%" /><br/><br/>
			<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/umbracoupd/vsproject-2.png" class="img-rounded" style="width: 100%; height:100%" />
</li>
<li>I've copied all the content of umbraco_original folder under my project root folder</li>			
<li>I've included files and folders to my project<br>
			<img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/umbracoupd/vsproject-3.png" class="img-rounded" />
</li>			
<li>I've modified <b>web.config</b> to point my new database instance<br>


<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: html">
<![CDATA[
<connectionStrings>
	<remove name="umbracoDbDSN"/>
	<add name="umbracoDbDSN" connectionString="server=yourserver;database=yourdb;user id=useradmin;password=password" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
]]></script>Â 

</li>		
<li>I've compiled solution and run (F5)</li>	
<li>The first run opened the installer that I've followed till the end, creating a new working application and database</li>	
</ol>

That's all. 

Very easy, but, anyway, I've documented it, because it costed less than remembering it every time I needed to recreate original installation.

And I didn't want to waste my time in so simple (and with low value) tasks. 
So, my lesson learned (in previous experiences) is **document everything** in this kind of prototyping. 

It's cheaper than not doing it.
