The site aims to be a collection of articles that trace the logbook of ideation 
and implementation of a web application aimed at the world of teachers. 

State of the art, among other commitments, 
I'm not sure I can see the end, but the purpose is to draw everything, because I'm little forgetful (believe me) and in couple of months I will not remember anything, 
and a bit for some form of gratitude to the many bloggers I read for 
create many of the skills that I have acquired during the project. 

For this reason I'm going to write technical articles in English, because 
most of the ones that I have been helpful, even by Italian bloggers, were in English.
