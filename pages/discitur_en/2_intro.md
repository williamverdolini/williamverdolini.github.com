The Discitur project, arises from the much more ambitious Magister project. 
So it is important to spend a few words about this project.


### Magister Project

Magister is a project that I started in 2009 or so, more or 
less with the same objectives of today:

1.    learn and keep me updated on recent web technologies  (since I had no way to experiment and to deepen the work). At that time 
I based on Java: JSF, EJB 3, J2EE, SOA, Hibernate, Mysql, there was already a 
Ajax strong interest in the enterprise business, but they seemed toys 
residing on the client browser ... now things are a little changed

2.    improve the (italian) school system . I know, the
project is ambitious , but I think ( and I'm sure I'm not the only one) that it is important to improve the current situation.
The thing I always found a paradox: in the cradle of civilization,
there is no method actually applied to improve teaching. The good
Teachers are teachers that mainly with common sense and the
word of mouth and as long as the passion does not fade, improve its method of
teaching with personal experimentation, not very effective. There is not a school
that teaches to become better teachers (and I mean a school that really works) , there is no specific criteria for the teacher evaluation,
of their teaching, there is a no sharing of made experiences among teachers, there is no analysis of the successes and failures ... nothing. And we are
speaking of those who should form the next generations. I always
thought it was an area on which to intervene...at least in my small way , I try.

3.    create my skills, experience and ability, which 
are also aspects that work rewards (that's what I was taught and that 
I deeply believe)

years later all three reasons are still valid today and, 
as then, I am excited to embark on this project. Then things get 
were interrupted, but in the middle there were several changes (marriage, 
job change, a daughter, a house), the situation today is more stable 
than in the past and maybe I have more free time to devote to this 
project...so, who knows, it comes out really something.


### Discitur: the beginning

The Magister project is very large; every time I tried to face it in the last weeks I got lost in the dozens of streams:
I always have ideas for new and important features and it was taking me off the road.
So I decided to achieve a first application, a sort of "Incipit" (to keep the Latin) of the Magister project,
that would allow me to achieve my goals without aging (too much).
I called **"Discitur"**, the Latin translation for **"Lesson Learned"** , which is one of the concepts of improvement that I would like it developed in the teachers:
**the application wants to be a platform for sharing good and bad practices of teaching, analyzing the pros and cons,
in order to reuse and refine the application on the part of many teachers.**


The scope is limited and there are all the elements to experiment, learn and grow.
I feel like a happy child (this is the perfect time to go to sleep :)) .
