Here is a series of large and small technical issues I faced 
and resolved during the project. I do not claim to be a series of technical articles 
from which to take inspiration, but only the history of a typical software development project. 
If you come to read up to here, it means that with these aspects you have to 
do every day. 



I organized these aspects in terms of Sprint Reviews, with analyzes and considerations of what went right and what went wrong 
from time to time. _The Lesson Learned_.
